Hi, I’m Ducky!!
I'm a student studying Computer Science. I’m interested in learning new technologies and developing my problem-solving skills. I'm currently working through the Odin Project to reinforce the fundamentals of programming and work on my portfolio while completing coursework. I'm always up for advice and/or a chat!
