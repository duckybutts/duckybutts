Hi, I’m Ducky!!
I’m interested in learning new technologies and developing my problem solving skills. I'm a sophomore studying 
Software Engineering at ASU. I'm currently working through the Odin Project to polish and apply my knowledge of the fundamentals of programming. I'm hoping to develop a strong foundation in javascript and web development to use as a medium for practicing more complex topics throughout my degree and career. I'm always up for advice and/or a chat!
